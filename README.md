## About The Project

FusionConnect is a social-community-based DeFi Dapp wherein users who are a part of the community can look up various details about other users in the community and leverage this knowledge to make better-informed decisions in the space of defi investments.

Key Features:

* Users also have the option to follow the transactions of their followings and lead investors in the space using the transaction tab in which they can see all the recent transactions done by a particular lens profile or an address. 
* Users also have the choice to make and be part of the community by following other people in the space.
* Users can see the common POAPs and NFTs they have in common with other followers and users and make a community on the same platform where they get inspiration investing.
* The integrated Fusion swap mode allows users to swap for the tokens they want using the 1 in click fusion mode which gives them MEV protection, limit order and best prices from across the DEXes.

These features foster a community experience conducive for beginners and experts in the DeFi field alike!
